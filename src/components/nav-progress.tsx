/**
 * An indeterminate bar pinned to the top of the viewport. Fixed rather than inline so it
 * reads the same whether the click landed on a sidebar row, a tag inside the mobile
 * sheet or a pagination button — and so no layout shifts wherever it is rendered.
 *
 * It goes through a portal because `position: fixed` is not as absolute as it sounds: a
 * `filter` or `transform` anywhere above makes that ancestor the containing block, and
 * the facet list's ➕/➖ carry a `filter` — rendered in place, the bar came out 24px wide
 * on the button that was clicked. On the body it can only ever mean the whole page.

 * `?page=` and stays on the same segment, so the fallback never appears: until the
 * server answers, the click looks like it did nothing. This is what the docs point at
 * for exactly that case.
