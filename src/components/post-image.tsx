/**
 * The post in the page, and pressing it opens it over the page with nothing else on
 * screen.
 *
 * In the document the picture shares the window with a header, a search box and whatever
 * of the tags reaches over the fold, and it is capped at `78dvh` so that it does. Opened,
 * it has the whole viewport and is fitted to *that* — which is the difference between the
 * two views, and the whole of it. It opens over the page rather than growing in place:
 * an image that expands mid-document pushes the tags below it a screen and a half down
 * and leaves the reader somewhere they did not scroll to.
 *
 * **Fitted, never scrolled.** A dialog the picture is bigger than is a picture you look
 * at through a letterbox — panning around a post to find out what it is of is worse than
 * seeing all of it slightly smaller, and the point of opening it was to see all of it.
 *
 * A real `<dialog>`, opened with `showModal`, because everything a lightbox has to get
 * right is already in it — Escape closes it, focus is trapped inside it, the rest of the
 * page is inert, and `::backdrop` is the dim without a div. What is left to write is the
 * click, which is the one gesture the element has no opinion about.
 *
 * There is no ✕. The picture opens by being pressed and closes the same way, and a
 * button in the corner is a second way to do the one thing in here — drawn over the post
 * it was covering, which is what opening it was for.
 *
 * `unoptimized` on purpose, in both views: the detail page shows the stored file
 * byte-for-byte. That file is either the upload itself or the AVIF the pipeline stored in
 * its place, so it already is the best version this site holds — running it through the
 * Next optimizer would re-encode it at quality 75 and strip animation. Compression
 * belongs to the thumbnail, which the grid uses instead.

/**
 * A modal dialog makes the page behind it inert, but not still: the wheel still scrolls
 * the document under the backdrop, so the picture is let go of and the reader closes the
 * dialog somewhere else entirely. Restoring the value rather than clearing it leaves a

          through — where the one gesture anybody tries on a picture they want a better
          look at is clicking the picture. `cursor-zoom-in` is what says so before the
          click, since a bare image says nothing about being pressable.

          **It is also a stage of a fixed height.** Sized to the picture, the box was as
          tall as whatever post was in it, so every step of the walk moved the tags under
          it — a portrait post pushed them a screen down and the landscape one after it
          pulled them back up, which is a page rebuilding itself around each image rather
          than showing a different one. At one height the header, the picture and the
          words below it stay where they are and only the picture changes. The image is
          still never enlarged past its own pixels: a small post sits in the middle of the
          stage rather than being blown up to fill it. */}
