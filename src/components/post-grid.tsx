/**
 * Justified rows, the way Google Photos lays a gallery out: every row spans the full
 * width, and the row's height is whatever makes that true, so ratios survive untouched.
 *
 * It is pure flexbox — no measuring pass, no client component, so the grid stays a plain
 * server render. The trick is that an item's `flex-grow` and its `flex-basis` are both
 * proportional to its aspect ratio. Free space is then handed out in the same proportion
 * as the bases, so every item in a row ends at `ratio × H` for one shared H: the row
 * fills the line exactly and nothing is squashed or cropped. (Flexbox subtracts the gaps
 * before distributing, so the gutters don't spoil the fit.)
 *
 * Sizing is a band rather than a number. Wrapping happens at the basis, so the basis is
 * the *shortest* a row may be and the cap is the tallest — items are laid out small and
 * then grown into the line. The cap is what saves the ragged last row of a chunk: without
 * it a single leftover thumb would stretch across the whole width. Every item caps at the
 * same row height, so a capped row stays uniform, it just stops short of the right edge.
